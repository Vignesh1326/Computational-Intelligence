This folder contains two python codes to derive the output of Boolean Gates: not, and, or, nand, nor, xor, xnor.

1. Boolean_Gates_NN.py code recreates a TLN design by manually assigning weight values for each neuron inputs.

2. Boolean_Gates_Keras.py code uses Keras Library where a Sequestial model is created and the model is trained to attain the required output by identifying correct weight values.
